# DES-algorithm
This is a simplified DES encryption that uses one round of encryption, as well as the same substitution tables for all blocks.
The program contains 4 files:
1) tables.py - contains input information: tables, key and input bits.
2) def_table.py - contains text processing functions using tables.
3) L_R_work.py - contains a function for working with subblocks.
4) main.py - the main file that combines the work of the above files.

This division was made for my convenience when writing code.
